    "===== What is a race condition:\n",
    "    \n",
    "A race condition occurs when two threads try to access a shared variable simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thread reads the value from the shared variable. The second thread also reads the value from the same shared variable.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "==== What is a Deadlock\n",
    "\n",
    "A deadlock is a concurrency failure mode where a thread or threads wait for a condition that never occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is that the deadlock threads are unable to progress and the program is stuck or frozen and must be terminated forcefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways in which you may encounter a deadlock in your concurrent program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deadlocks are not developed intentionally, instead, they are an unexpected side effect or bug in concurrency programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common examples of the cause of threading deadlocks include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) A thread that waits on itself (e.g. attempts to acquire the same mutex lock twice).\n",
    "2) Threads that wait on each other (e.g. A waits on B, B waits on A).\n",
    "3) Thread that fails to release a resource (e.g. mutex lock, semaphore, barrier, condition, event, etc.).\n",
    "4) Threads that acquire mutex locks in different orders (e.g. fail to perform lock ordering)."
