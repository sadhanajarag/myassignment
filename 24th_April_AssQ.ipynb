    "- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a technique used to reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional datasets. One of the key steps in PCA is to identify the principal components (or directions) that capture the most variation in the data. These principal components are the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of the data.\n",

We can project each data point onto the principal components to obtain a lower-dimensional representation of the data.

This results in a set of coordinates that describe the position of the data point in the principal component space.\n",
