    "#### 1. Inertia or Sum of Squared Errors (SSE): \n",
    "    Inertia measures the sum of squared distances between each sample and its centroid in a clustering algorithm such as k-means. Lower inertia indicates better clustering, as it suggests that the samples are closer to their respective centroids.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Silhouette Coefficient: \n",
    "    The Silhouette Coefficient measures the compactness and separation of clusters. It calculates the average silhouette coefficient for each sample, which is based on the distance between the sample and its own cluster compared to the distance to the nearest neighboring cluster. The coefficient ranges from -1 to 1, with higher values indicating better clustering and well-separated clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Calinski-Harabasz Index: \n",
    "    The Calinski-Harabasz Index evaluates the ratio of between-cluster dispersion to within-cluster dispersion. It calculates the ratio of the sum of between-cluster dispersion to the sum of within-cluster dispersion. Higher values indicate better clustering, as it suggests that the clusters are more separated.\n",

    "- Lower inertia, lower Silhouette Coefficient, and higher values of the Calinski-Harabasz Index and Davies-Bouldin Index indicate better clustering performance.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### - Imbalanced Datasets: \n",
    "    Accuracy does not consider class imbalances in the dataset. If the classes are imbalanced, a high accuracy can be misleading. For example, if 95% of the instances belong to class A and only 5% belong to class B, a naive classifier that predicts all instances as class A will have a high accuracy of 95%, but it fails to capture the minority class B. In such cases, metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score that consider true positives, false positives, and false negatives are more informative.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - Misclassification Costs:\n",
    "    Accuracy treats all misclassifications equally, without considering the potential costs associated with different types of errors. In many real-world scenarios, the cost of misclassifying one class may be significantly higher than misclassifying another class. Evaluation metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score can help in considering the specific costs associated with different types of errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - Probability Estimation:\n",
    "    Accuracy does not take into account the confidence or probability estimates of the predictions. In some cases, it is important to have reliable probability estimates to make informed decisions. Evaluation metrics like log loss or area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) can be used to assess the quality of probability estimates.\n",
