    "Interval estimate:\n",
    "         An interval estimate is defined by two numbers, between which a population parameter is said to lie. For example, a < x < b is an interval estimate of the population mean μ. It indicates that the population mean is greater than a but less than b.\n",

    "2) A statistic.\n",

    "            \n",
    "example :\n",
    "         if you construct a confidence interval with a 95% confidence level, you are confident that 95 out of 100 times the estimate will fall between the upper and lower values specified by the confidence interval.\n",

    "Hypothesis testing in statistics refers to analyzing an assumption about a population parameter.\n",

    "4) Hypothesis testing is common in statistics as a method of making decisions using data. \n",
    "5) Hypothesis testing provides various techniques to test the hypothesis statement depending upon the variable and the data points. It finds its use in almost every field of research while answering statements such as whether this new medicine will work, a new testing method is appropriate, or if the outcomes of a random experiment are probable or not.\n",
    "6) In short by hypothesis testing we can check if the assumption made by expert team is accept or reject.\n",
    "\n",

    "Importance :\n",

    "1) Hypothesis testing is one of the most important concepts in statistics because it is how you decide if something really happened, or if certain treatments have positive effects, or if groups differ from each other or if one variable predicts another.\n",
    " In short, you want to proof if your data is statistically significant and unlikely to have occurred by chance alone. In essence then, a hypothesis test is a test of significance.\n",
    " \n",
